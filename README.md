# Shadeseeker
## Design and Code for Shadeseeker Robot

### Purpose:
   The Robot is designed to roam around and find the darkest spots in a room.
  
### [Random Ideas]
    -(Optional, control from a computer possibly)
    -(Make a custom User Interface that warns user when a spot in a room is dark enough)
    -(Camera for the Robot)
    -(LCD Screen for light levels)
    
### Materials:
- Arduino Mega Board
- Breadboard
- DC Motors (2x)
- Ultra Sonic Sensors (2x)
- light sensors (4x)
- LEDs (4x) (Different colors)
- Caster (for third wheel)
- Speaker
- 9v Battery
- H Bridge
- Resistors

### Materials that are going to be created though CAD and 3d software:
- Body
- Wheels
